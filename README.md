# Repository for the YouTube Channel @talkpopgen
Welcome! This repository houses all of the code for running the simulations and data analyses that appear on the YouTube channel @talkpopgen run by Zach B. Hancock. Most of the scripts you find are annotated so that you can follow along with what is happening.

This repository will be periodically updated as I try to include all the data from older videos on the channel and compile walkthroughs to help guide you through the data analysis process. 

Feel free to reach out at zachbhancock [at] gmail [dot] com if you have questions/issues.
